### **Project Overview**

**Title:** LIME Explainable AI: Interpreting Machine Learning Models

**Description:**  
In this project, we will build a repository that demonstrates how to use LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret machine learning models. LIME is a popular technique for explaining the predictions of any machine learning classifier by perturbing the input data and learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. This repository will include code examples, explanations, and visualizations to help users understand how LIME can be applied to different types of machine learning models (e.g., classifiers, regressors) and datasets.

**Key Features of the Project:**
1. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., decision tree, random forest, or neural network) on a sample dataset.
2. **Model Interpretation Using LIME**: Use LIME to interpret the predictions of the trained model. Show how LIME can provide insights into the model’s decision-making process.
3. **Visualizations**: Generate and include visualizations that illustrate the explanations provided by LIME.
4. **Use Cases and Examples**: Provide several examples of using LIME with different datasets and models to showcase its flexibility and usefulness.

### **File Structure**

To organize the repository effectively, we’ll use the following file structure:

## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LIME-Explainable-AI.git
   cd LIME-Explainable-AI
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the Required Packages**:
   Install all the required Python packages using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Jupyter Notebook** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

---

## **How to Run**

1. **Run the Flask Application**:
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Flask application. The Flask app will provide a user interface to upload datasets and generate LIME explanations.

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface**:
   Open your browser and go to:
   ```plaintext
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
   This will bring up the interface where you can upload data, generate model explanations, and view results.

## **Using the LIME Explainer**

### 1. **Upload Dataset**:
   - Go to the **Upload** page (`upload.html`).
   - Upload a CSV file with your dataset.
   
### 2. **Train a Model**:
   - Train your model using `train_model.py` script in the `models/` directory. You can modify the script to work with different models such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   python models/train_model.py
   ```

### 3. **Generate LIME Explanations**:
   - Once a model is trained, LIME explanations can be generated.
   - In the **Explanation** tab (`explanation.html`), select the model and input data you want to explain.

### 4. **View the Results**:
   - LIME results will be displayed visually with interactive charts and explanations. The results can also be saved in the `results/` folder.

## **Visualizations**

The **LIME Explainer** offers visual insights into model behavior:

- **Feature Importance**: LIME shows the importance of individual features in making a prediction.
- **Perturbation Effects**: How changes to input features affect model predictions.

All visual outputs are stored in the `results/figures/` directory.

## **Examples and Use Cases**

We provide a few examples of how LIME can be used to explain different models in the Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks/` folder. These notebooks demonstrate:

1. **lime_explanation_example.ipynb**: An example using LIME to interpret a classifier’s prediction.
2. **additional_examples.ipynb**: Additional examples and use cases for LIME on different models and datasets.

You can run these notebooks using:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
