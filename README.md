# LIME-Explainable-AI

### **Project Overview**

**Title:** LIME Explainable AI: Interpreting Machine Learning Models

**Description:**  
In this project, we will build a repository that demonstrates how to use LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret machine learning models. LIME is a popular technique for explaining the predictions of any machine learning classifier by perturbing the input data and learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. This repository will include code examples, explanations, and visualizations to help users understand how LIME can be applied to different types of machine learning models (e.g., classifiers, regressors) and datasets.

**Key Features of the Project:**
1. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., decision tree, random forest, or neural network) on a sample dataset.
2. **Model Interpretation Using LIME**: Use LIME to interpret the predictions of the trained model. Show how LIME can provide insights into the model’s decision-making process.
3. **Visualizations**: Generate and include visualizations that illustrate the explanations provided by LIME.
4. **Use Cases and Examples**: Provide several examples of using LIME with different datasets and models to showcase its flexibility and usefulness.

### **File Structure**

To organize the repository effectively, we’ll use the following file structure:
